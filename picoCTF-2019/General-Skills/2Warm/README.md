__PROBLEM__

Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)? 

__HINT__

Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

__SOLUTION__

This is just a conversion from a decimal number to binary number. Using python to find it:
```python
bin(42)
'0b101010'
```

FLAG - picoCTF{101010}
