__Problem__

> Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)? 

__Hint__

> Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

__Solution__

This is just a conversion from a decimal number to binary number. Using python to find it:
```python
bin(42)
'0b101010'
```

__Flag__ 

> picoCTF{101010}
